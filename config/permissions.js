// Here's how permissions work:
//
// For a User to be able to do one of the actions listed here,
// their permissions level and group assignment have to allow them to do so.
//
// Permission level is 'at least', so someone with
// a 'low' permission cannot do 'high' permission actions but
// someone with a 'high' permission can do 'low' permission actions.
// Permission level is based on the provider they used to authenticate (eg. Google, Slack).
//
// A User must also be in one of the specified groups to do the action.
// For a User to be in the 'primary' group, they need to be an 'active' Officer w/ 'primaryOfficer' set to 'true'
// For a User to be in the 'officers' group, they need to be an 'active' Officer
// For a User to be in the 'mentors' group, they need to be an 'active' Mentor
